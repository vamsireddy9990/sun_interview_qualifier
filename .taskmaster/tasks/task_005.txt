# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Analysis Trigger and Loading Indicator
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the 'Analyze Resumes' button and implement a loading indicator during the analysis process.
# Details:
1. Add an 'Analyze Resumes' button that is enabled only when both resumes and job description are provided
2. Implement a loading spinner or progress bar during analysis:
```python
if st.button('Analyze Resumes', disabled=not (resumes_uploaded and job_description)):
    with st.spinner('Analyzing resumes... This may take a minute.'):
        results = []
        for resume_file, resume_text in zip(uploaded_resumes, extracted_texts):
            result = analyze_resume(resume_text, job_description)
            result['resume_name'] = resume_file.name
            results.append(result)
        
        # Store results in session state
        st.session_state.analysis_results = results
```
3. Add a progress bar to show advancement through multiple resumes
4. Implement timeout handling for long-running analyses
5. Add cancellation option for users

# Test Strategy:
Test the button activation logic with various input states. Verify loading indicators display correctly during analysis. Test with multiple resumes to ensure progress tracking works. Test cancellation functionality.
