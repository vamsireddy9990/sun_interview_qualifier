# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Session Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Add functionality to manage user session state and preserve data between interactions.
# Details:
1. Initialize session state variables at app startup:
```python
def initialize_session_state():
    if 'uploaded_resumes' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.uploaded_resumes = []
    if 'job_description' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.job_description = ""
    if 'analysis_results' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.analysis_results = []
```
2. Implement functions to update session state
3. Add ability to clear current session data
4. Preserve analysis results between page refreshes
5. Add session timeout handling
6. Implement state management for multi-step workflow

# Test Strategy:
Test session persistence across page refreshes. Verify state is properly maintained during user interactions. Test clear functionality. Verify session timeout behavior.
