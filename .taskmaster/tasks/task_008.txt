# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5, 6

# Description: Design and implement a clean, intuitive user interface following the PRD specifications.
# Details:
1. Create a header with app title and brief description

3. Use Streamlit's columns feature for layout organization
4. Add custom CSS for styling improvements:
```python
def apply_custom_css():
    st.markdown("""
    <style>
    .stApp {
        max-width: 1200px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
    .result-table {
        margin-top: 2rem;
    }
    </style>
    """, unsafe_allow_html=True)
```
5. Add tooltips and help text for better user guidance
6. Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes
7. Use consistent color scheme and typography

# Test Strategy:
Test UI on different screen sizes and browsers. Verify layout is intuitive and sections are clearly separated. Get feedback from potential users on usability.
