# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Resume Upload Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the UI component for uploading multiple PDF resumes and extract text from them.
# Details:
1. Create a file uploader component in Streamlit that accepts multiple PDF files
2. Add validation to ensure only PDF files are accepted
3. Implement PDF text extraction using PyPDF2:
```python
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file):
    text = ""
    try:
        pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdf_file)
        for page in pdf_reader.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()
        return text
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error extracting text from {pdf_file.name}: {str(e)}")
        return None
```
4. Store extracted text in a session state variable along with file names
5. Display confirmation message showing number of resumes successfully uploaded

# Test Strategy:
Test with various PDF files including single and multi-page documents. Verify text extraction works correctly. Test with invalid file types to ensure proper error handling.
